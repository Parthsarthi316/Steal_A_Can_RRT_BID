From saving a forest fire to stealing a can... I expected a better use of motion planning
from you..... But still.....there u go:

Run rrt_star_bidirectional_6d.py to get the optimal path estimated by our
RRT to help you steal that can.

Remember to make a folder named frames_try in the root directory to store frames of the
generated plots. Do checkout the requirements.txt file before using our algorithm
for any kind of help.
